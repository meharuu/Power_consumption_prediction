# Power_consumption_prediction
This project demonstrates an hourly based power consumption for 100 different buildings from 1st June 2024 to 31st August 2024 in South Korea

Different files are uploaded, as each demonstrates a different configuration for achieving optimal performance. As this dataset contains 10 different types of buildings, which total up to 100, a detailed analysis of each building's consumption was also done to identify outliers. "bldgs.ipynb" serves that purpose. 

The dataset was obtained from the Dacon.io competition, and by this approach, I achieved an SMAPE of 7.50%.
